# 👋 Hi, I'm Kai!

I'm just getting started with coding — excited, curious, and fully committed to learning.
Right now, I'm exploring JavaScript, Node.js, and the tools that power modern development.

I’m also building my first real project: DOTS, a map-based messaging app.
It’s still early, but I’m sharing my journey publicly to learn, improve, and connect with people who can guide me along the way.

How to build simple apps & scripts

Git & GitHub

Node.js & package managers

Basic front-end concepts (HTML, CSS)

## 🛠 Tools I’m Using

macOS

Homebrew

Git

Node.js

VS Code

## 🎯 Goals

Build and publish my first full app

Collaborate with open-source developers

Understand best practices in coding and clean code

Keep improving every day — even small steps count
